# 🧠 C++ Assignment 1 – Basic Concepts

Welcome to my first C++ programming assignment! This project is part of my academic coursework and focuses on building a strong foundation in basic programming logic using C++.

## 🚀 Overview

This assignment consists of multiple beginner-friendly problems designed to strengthen core concepts such as:

- ✅ Conditional Statements (`if-else`)
- ✅ Basic String Handling
- ✅ Console-Based Interaction

> ⚠️ Note: Loops, arrays, and functions were **not** used, as per the assignment guidelines. The focus was entirely on logic building with the most basic tools in C++.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to apply logical thinking using `if-else` structures
- How to handle simple string operations
- Writing clear, readable code without advanced constructs
- The value of debugging and learning from small errors

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Environment:** Console-based (Ubuntu and VS code)

## ✨ Reflection

This was my first step into the world of programming, and I’m proud to have completed it! While I encountered a few challenges and made some mistakes, every error was a chance to learn and improve. Looking forward to growing with each assignment!
